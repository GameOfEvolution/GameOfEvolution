## Game of Evolution 
# Emergence of 3D Networks through Autonomous Particles

I present a new algorithm that explores the evolution of complex and organic networks through the behavior of autonomous particles, which have properties of living creatures. The algorithm utilizes different feedforward neural networks to govern the behavior of individual particles, which are linked together to form a graph. These particles interact with their neighbors and compete for scarce fungible tokens to survive and reproduce. Over time, natural selection sorts out fragile behaviors while promoting the growth of antifragile ones. The algorithm allows for a wide range of settings, leading to diverse incentive structures and macroscopic structures. Through testing various combinations of settings, I was able to observe the emergence of autonomous, decentralized, and three-dimensional networks which are always evolving.
